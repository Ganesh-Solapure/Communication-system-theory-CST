 What is inter symbol interference?

Answer:  Since the bandwidth of channel is limited so the transmitted pulses may not retain their shape at the output of channel. So the transmitted pulses tend to spread during transmission. This pulse spreading or dispersion causes overlap of pulses into adjacent time slots which results an error at the receiver. The error is known as inter symbol interference.
 Nyquist rate is the sampling rate at which the sampling frequency is twice that of the maximum frequency component of the continuous time signal.
fs  = 2fm 


If nyquist rate is maintained for the sampling process, then that is said to be a perfect sampling process.
 
 Sampling theorem states that in order to reconstruct the continuous time signal from a discrete time signal, the sampling frequency taken should be more than or equal to twice of the maximum frequency of the continuous time signal frequency.
fs  â‰¥ 2fm
Violation of sampling theorem yields to aliasing effect. We cannot reconstruct the original signal from its samples, if sampling theorem is not maintained.

What is Pulse Code Modulation in communication system?
A digital technique that involves sampling an analog signal at regular intervals and coding the measured amplitude into a series of binary values, which are transmitted by modulation of a pulsed, or intermittent, carrier.
 
 Pulse code modulation (PCM)  is a digital scheme for transmitting analog data. It converts an analog signal into digital form.

 Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) is a technique that converts an analog signal into a digital signal. DPCM uses the baseline of pulse-code modulation (PCM) but adds some functionalities based on the prediction of the samples of the signal

Delta modulation (DM) is a signal conversion technique that converts analog signals to digital and digital signals to analog. It's used in data transmission systems and speech communication when quality is not a concern

 Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a method of putting multiple data streams in a single signal by separating the signal into many segments, each having a very short duration. Each individual data stream is reassembled at the receiving end based on the timing.

Probability distribution functions (PDFs) describe the expected values of random variables drawn from a sample.

The CDF is calculated by integrating the Probability Density Function (PDF).

sampling is the process of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal. It's also defined as the process of measuring the discrete instantaneous values of a continuous-time signal.

 Quantization in digital communication can be defined as the process of conversion of infinite continuous values into a set of discrete finite values.

Encoding is the process of turning thoughts into communication. The encoder uses a 'medium' to send the message

 Line coding is a method that converts binary data into a digital signal

 A matched filter is a linear filter that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a signal in the presence of noise. It's a powerful signal processing technique that detects weak signals in noisy data

 Intersymbol interference (ISI) is a type of signal distortion that occurs when one symbol interferes with subsequent symbols.
